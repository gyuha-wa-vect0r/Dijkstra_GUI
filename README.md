## Project Overview üåü
This project implements the **Dijkstra Algorithm** to calculate the shortest path between nodes in a graph and visualizes the results in a **GUI interface**. The goal is to enhance understanding of data structures and algorithms by integrating them with a practical graphical interface.

### Background üß†
The Dijkstra algorithm is widely used in network optimization, pathfinding in maps, and solving graph-based problems. This project allows users to create and manipulate graphs while exploring shortest path computations visually.

### Key Features ‚ú®
1. **Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Calculates the shortest path from a starting node to other nodes within a given graph.
   - Evaluates paths based on weights assigned to edges.

2. **GUI Interface**:
   - Enables the creation of graph nodes and edges.
   - Visualizes shortest path results based on user input.
   - Intuitive interface for better understanding of pathfinding.

3. **Additional Task**:
   - Investigates the `count-to-infinity` issue in Distance Vector algorithms and explores the **Poisoned Reverse** technique as a solution.

## Implementation Details üîç

### Dijkstra Algorithm (`controllers.py`)
1. **`init`**:
   - Initializes the graph, setting all node distances to infinity and the start node's distance to 0.

2. **`search_min`**:
   - Finds and returns the node with the minimum distance in the queue.
   - Iterates through the queue, comparing `graph.distances[node]` to identify the minimum.

3. **`update_distances`**:
   - Updates the shortest distances for nodes connected to the current node.
   - Modifies `graph.distances` and sets predecessor nodes in `graph.preds`.

4. **`dijkstra`**:
   - Combines the above functions to execute the Dijkstra algorithm step by step.
   - Uses a queue to process nodes and excludes completed nodes from further exploration.

5. **`find_path`**:
   - Builds the shortest path from the start node to the target node using calculated data.

### GUI Interface (`main.py`, `views.py`)
1. **Node and Edge Creation**:
   - Allows users to dynamically construct graph structures.
2. **Path Visualization**:
   - Highlights the computed shortest path in red on the GUI.
3. **Intuitive Interaction**:
   - Supports node movement, deletion, and connection using a mouse.

## Major Code Updates ‚úçÔ∏è

### `controllers.py` Detailed Changes

#### **`search_min` Function**:
   - Implemented logic to find the node with the minimum distance from the queue.
   - Compares `graph.distances[node]` values to determine the minimum.

   ```python
   for node in queue:
       if graph.distances[node] < mini:
           mini = graph.distances[node]
           node_m = node
   return node_m
   ```

#### **`update_distances` Function**:
   - Calculates weights to update shortest paths for adjacent nodes.
   - Updates `graph.distances` and sets the predecessor for each updated node.

   ```python
   if graph.distances[node_x] > graph.distances[node] + weight_x:
       graph.distances[node_x] = graph.distances[node] + weight_x
       graph.preds[node_x] = node
   ```

#### **`dijkstra` Function**:
   - Integrates `search_min` and `update_distances` to perform the algorithm iteratively.
   - Removes nodes from the queue after processing to streamline operations.

   ```python
   while len(queue) != 0:
       min_n = search_min(graph, queue)
       update_distances(graph, min_n)
       queue.remove(min_n)
   ```

#### **`find_path` Function**:
   - Uses the results of the Dijkstra algorithm to construct the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.

## Results and Demonstration üé®

1. **Graph Creation and Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - Users can add nodes and edges via the GUI, then select start and end nodes to compute the shortest path.
   - The resulting path is visually emphasized in red.

2. **Execution Example**:
   - Below is an example showing nodes, edges, and the computed shortest path:

## Additional Task: Poisoned Reverse üõ†Ô∏è

### Problem Definition
The `count-to-infinity` problem in Distance Vector algorithms arises from routing loops, where incorrect path costs propagate infinitely.

### Solution: Poisoned Reverse
1. Nodes transmit "infinite" path costs for specific routes to prevent loops.
2. This ensures that incorrect routing information does not propagate back to its source.

#### Key Principle
- If Node A updates its route to Node C via Node B, it sets the cost of Node C to infinity when informing Node B, breaking the loop.

More detailed explanations are provided in the accompanying report.
